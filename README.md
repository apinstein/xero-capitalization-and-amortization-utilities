# XERO Capitalization and Amoritization Utilities

## The Problem

The proper way to account for things like loans, prepaid services, and deferred revenue involves creating a series of entries to properly record the accounting item of interest.

Unfortunately, XERO doesn't have a built-in feature to create amortization or capitalization schedules for these items, making it a tedious, error-prone, manual process to properly record such things in XERO.

## The Solution

Fortunately, XERO allows importing MJ's via CSV. This allows us to automate this entire process with less than 5 minutes of work.

## Instructions

1. Open the spreadsheet template corresponding to the specific situation you are dealing with.
1. Follow the directions on the CONFIG tab.

Enjoy your perfect and easy bookkeeping!

## Limitations

Xero assumes all transactions are CASH AND ACCRUAL by default. You can chance this by twiddling the 'show journal on cash basis' checkbox (uncheck to remove from cash basis). For loan amortizations this is actually perfect typically. You can edit each MJ however to accrual-only if you want after importing since there is no way to specify this via import.

## TODO / Future

I could make a Google Spreadsheet or XSLX of this. I tried exporting and importing, but it messed up all the forumlas and I didn't want to spend the time to fix. 

If you don't have a Mac and want me to make a schedule for you, email me and I'll do it for $10.
